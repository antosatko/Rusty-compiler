## About <a name = "about"></a>

Compiler for Rusty Danda programming language. This repository contains everything related to Rusty danda language processing. For bytecode interpreter look at https://github.com/it-2001/rusty-vm

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

All you need to do to get started is have cargo installed on your machine and clone this repository.

## Project Goals <a name = "goals"></a>

Main goal is to learn Rust, earn bragging rights and have some language to write my side projects in.

### Important
- [x] tokenization
- [x] preprocessing
- [x] parsing ast rules
- [x] generating ast
- [ ] ast analisys
- [ ] type check
- [ ] binary generation

### Other plans
- [ ] optimization on ast
- [ ] optimization on binary
- [ ] create installer for end user
- [ ] standard library
- [ ] game dev library
- [ ] (almost) fully featured compiler + vm on browser
- [x] draw mascot (credits: https://github.com/antosmichael07)

### End Goal
- [ ] write a graphical game to demonstrate my languge
- [x] learn Rust
- [x] have fun

## Syntax <a name = "syntax"></a>
This is not really place to talk about syntax, but if you are interested, you can look at ast/rd.ast, where you can find source code for ast and also have a look at demos (only test.rd is guaranteed to be up to date).
