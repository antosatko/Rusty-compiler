AST stands for abstract syntax tree
It is Rusty danda compiler specific structure, 
you wont find it anywhere else.
This file can be considered its documentation.
Syntax errors are non-existent at the moment 
so think twice before writing code. (you might
find yourself in an infinite loop :P)

Indentation is only for tabs, comments are not allowed, 
each structure must follow a set of rules:
1. Head - defines appearence of your structure
    identifier - structures are accesible by their identifiers
    parameters - params represent data returned by the structure
2. Body - defines internal structure of elements
    modifiers:
        expected element - structure throws an exception if the element is incorrect
            exceptions can be cought by optional elements, compiler reports syntax error if not
        optional elements (?) - optionals can nest another elements,
            these are accesed if the parent element is true
        commands (!) - commands are executable scripts written in compiler
            they help to write cleaner, more intelligent code
        optional arguments (=) - runs nested code if passed argument is equal
    element types:
        token (,) - tokens are usually special characters
        text ("text") - 
        type ("'string") - types represent only type with undefined value
        structure (type) - executes code forspecified structure
    arguments: 
        small commands for individual elements
        type - "=" - value (set="params")
        fill list of arguments is on the way
3. End - ends structure definition
    semicolon at the end of last element (last element, NOT the end of branch, always only one end)

Compiler specific Element arguments:
    end (true) - structure returns its current state
    set (<target>) - head parameter is set/pushed elements return value
    back (unsigned integer) - code cursor is sent back
    lock (<target>) - prevents set argument from executing on target
    unlock (<target>) - allows for set argument to execute on target
    repeat (unsigned integer) - prevents element from repeating itself more than specified
To create own arguments just pass them to the structure
